trec_eval is the standard tool used by the TREC community for
evaluating an ad hoc retrieval run, given the results file and a
standard set of judged results.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation: Should be as easy as typing "make" in the source directory.
If you wish the trec_eval binary to be placed in a standard location, alter
the first line of Makefile appropriately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing: sample input and output files are included in the directory test.
"make quicktest" will perform some sample simple evaluations and compare
the results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:  Most options can be ignored.  The only one most folks will need
is the "-q" flag, to indicate whether to output official results for individual 
queries as well as the averages over all queries.  Official TREC usage
might be something like 
	trec_eval -q -c -M1000 official_qrels submitted_results 
to ensure correct evaluation if submitted_results doesn't have results
for all queries, or returns more than 1000 documents per query.
If you wish to output only one particular measure:
        trec_eval -m measure[.params] rel_info_file results_file

Change Log  (only recent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/25/08 Version 9.0alpha.  Complete rewrite of entire trec_eval (needed for a 
       long time!).  Complete separation of individual measure calculations -
       computers are now fast enough so can afford recalculation of lots
       of intermediate values.  Should be much easier to add measures to, and
       much easier to add new input file formats with associated measures.
       Parameters for measures (eg, cutoffs for P) can be specified on the
       command line.  Choice of measures can be specifed on the command line.
       An initial set of preference evaluation measures (with their own
       input rel_info format) have been added.
       Most important measures remain the same - the official TREC output
       (short output in some versions) should be completely unchanged.
       Measures added:
       	        ndcg, ndcg_at, set_F
		various preference evaluation measures.
       Measures renamed:
                R-prec-at.*             was *R-prec
                set_P			was exact_prec
	        set_recall 		was exact_recall
	        set_relative_P		was exact_relative_prec
	        set_recall		was exact_recall
	        set_map			was exact_unranked_avg_prec
       Measures dropped for now:
       		3-pt_avg       	
		avg_doc_prec   	
		avg_relative_prec	
		exact_relative_unranked_avg_prec	
		map_at_R       	
                int_map        	
                exact_int_R_rcl_prec
                int_map_at_R

Version 8.1, Added infAP, minor bug fixes
7/24/06 Improved infAP comments (implementation verified by Yilmaz).
        trec_eval_help.c: allow longer measure explanations.
6/27/06 get_opt.c Fixed error message
6/22/06 Added measure infAP (Aslam et al) to allow judging only sample 
        of pools.  -1 for rel in qrels file interpreted as pool doc not judged.
6/22/06 trvec_teval.c: fixed bugs in calculation of bpref if multiple
	relevance levels were used and a non-default relevance level
	was given. (Eg. A doc with rel level of 2 was counted as unjudged
	rather than judged nonrel if a relevance level of 3 was needed
	to consider relevant.)
4/5/06  Changed comments in README, trec_eval.c, trec_eval_help.c files 
        which incorrectly claimed queries with no relevant docs are 
        ignored (this was true with very old versions of trec_eval).  Now
        reads that queries with no relevance information are ignored.

Version 8.0, full bpref bug fix, see file bpref_bug.  I decided to up the 
        version number since bpref results are incompatible with previous 
        results (though the changes are small).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding a new measure.

Assuming it uses standard input files:
1. In m_<new_measure>.c, write any needed measure specific procedures needed to
      initialize measure
      calculate measure
      accumulate measure (adding one topic's value to summary value over topics)
      print measure for an individual topic
      print measure for summary over all topics, normally after averaging.
   Most measures require only a new calculate measure procedure - the
   other procedures are already implemented depending on the type of 
   measure (has cutoffs and value for each cutoff, parameters, is a float, etc).
   See functions.h to see any fit for these generic procedures.
2. Add prototype decarations for your new procedures in "functions.h".
3. Add any new default parameters for measure in "measures.c"
4. Add entry for new measure in "measures.c"
5. Add measure source file to Makefile

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding a new file format
1. Implement reading of new format in get_<new_format>.c, with returned top
   level output of type ALL_REL_INFO or ALL_RESULTS.  The individual topic
   returned values will be in a format dependent form which will be passed
   to the appropriate measures.
2. Add format to appropriate format list in formats.c
3. Add measures to take advantage of format (see above)
4. To use, invoke trec_eval with -R or -T values, and -m measures that
   are appropriate.

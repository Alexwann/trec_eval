## Compiling

To achieve a compilation of trec_eval for Windows, download the [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) platform.

## Running

The resulting trec_eval.exe should be usable on any machine without Cygwin installed, as long as the cygwin1.dll is available. For instance, place cygwin1.dll in the same directory as trec_eval.exe.
